# 🎄 Advent of Code 

Just a collection of my solutions and a means to practice programming languages.

## 🎁 Commands

Sync input files to each language dir:
```sh
make sync
```

If you only care about syncing to one of the dirs:
```sh
make typescript
```

Running a Rust problem:
```sh
make rs year=2024 problem=001
```

Running a TS problem:

```sh
deno --allow-read typescript/2024/001.ts
```
